Java Automation tool/chatbot Google maps Scrapper

This is version of my google_map_query tool originely made with python, adapted to java for a colege project. It implement the same functionality, using selenium to query information like: Name, Address, Website & Phone number.
I had problems running the selenium code diretly so i used a javascript executer to run the selenium code. I implemented a higher level chatbot to the tool as requered by my project, with a list of FAQ, and used a technique called FuzzyScore
chosen becouse i used a simialar one in python called FuzzyWuzzy on my "Mluz.db-project" repository; 

https://github.com/Superjoa10/Mluz.db-projects ; 

in there it is used to search for names with higher acuracy.

I do not take any resposibility as to how this tool is used, it is mearly for educational pourposes.
